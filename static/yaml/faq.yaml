"How do I pick which currency I want to be paid out in?":
    | 
    Your desired payout currency is automatically determined by the type of
    address you're mining with. So if you mine with a Bitcoin address as your
    username, then by default everything you mine will exchanged to Bitcoin and
    paid out to that address. This can be done since most (almost all) altcoins
    have a unique address "prefix", which is technically known as the address
    version. For instance, a Vertcoin address will always start with a "V", 
    while most Bitcoin addresses start with a "1".
"What if I want to keep X currency, and not have it Auto-Exchanged?":

    Your user settings page allows you to specify a payout address for any
    currency that you <i>don't</i> want to exchange to the currency of your
    mining addresses. Also note that some currencies <b>cannot</b> be exchanged
    for your mining currency and to recieve these currencies you <b>must</b>
    specify a payout address. These currencies are separated out on your
    settings page under "Unexchangeable Currencies".
