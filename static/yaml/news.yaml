- title: PPAgent 0.3 released, now with text+email notification! Also various site upgrades.
  date: 3/17/2014
  body: |
      To get setup you'll need to download the new release and upgrade your config file. Complete instructions available
      <a href="https://github.com/icook/ppagent">here</a>. We've also upgraded the pool stats page to show some helpful
      numbers like pool efficiency, estimated times for round completion, added tooltips to most confusing
      stats, and made closing alerts more permanent(clear your session to get them back). Also, a shout out to raid5
      for his dev time, thanks to him you can now <a href="https://github.com/ericecook/simpledoge/pull/37">easily
      remove recently viewed profiles</a> from the user stats page, and possibly can expect a mobile app in the future!
- title: Upgrade to 1.6 Complete
  date: 3/16/2014
  body: |
      Our mining server just switched over to 1.6 wallet in preparation for the fork. Make sure you 
      do the same with your local wallet or you won't see our payouts after Monday when the fork
      occurs.
- title: Third block found, payout bug occured and fixed.
  date: 3/15/2014
  body: |
     We got lucky, and the block payout was good too! Time for the bad news. With this last payout we hit a bug with
     our PPLNS algorithm. This bug only effected the most recent (3rd) payout, and we've already patched it. Basically, some people were
     paid out a little extra, some were paid out not quite enough. We've compiled <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/
     simpload.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgkBufaWF9yfdGtISjU0ZklvWjZHdGM4aV9FblVuMFE&usp=sharing#gid=0">a list for you
     guys</a> so you can see what happened. If you have a NEGATIVE total owed, no worries you got overpaid a bit, lucky bonus payout for you :D.
     If your total owned is POSITIVE we will be sending you a compensating transaction. Sorry for the hassle, this should be a one time deal.
- title: Second block found, big user stats upgrade!
  date: 3/15/2014
  body: |
     Blarg, another small block. This one(22k) was 11x lower than average, the 1.6 update can't get here soon enough. But
     we have put up a significant update to user stats, you'll notice that you can now view a per worker breakdown, even if you are
     not running PPAgent. There are some bugs we are working out at the moment(one of them is per worker hashrate), so please bear with
     us while we tweak things.
- title: Found the first block!
  date: 3/14/2014
  body: |
     It was a smallish one, ~72k, but we've run the first payout and you should see your hard earned
     Doge in your account shortly :D We are available in IRC if you have any questions about whats going on. The finder was
     <a href="http://simpledoge.com/DDTGag9oaBMRxCmknEMRGBu5hby93VHFrY">DDTGag9oaBMRxCmknEMRGBu5hby93VHFrY</a>, and they are the
     first winner of our <a href="https://dogechain.info/tx/92bca00d141c3677919cdcaa1c79066f1a4cecc863eace5d9f5fd5039147d3e0">
     10k block finder reward</a> ! Congrats, and thanks for mining with us :D

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-9">
      The top right pool stats have been tweaked.
      <ul>
      <li>you'll notice that the pool luck now counts downwards. This makes
      much more sense intuitively.</li>
      <li>MHash/sec now rounds to the nearest .1</li>
      <li>We've added a pool worker count</li>
      </ul>
      We've fixed a bug on the stats page that was caused by an occasional divide by 0 error. doh.<br>
      If theres a feature or stat you'd like to see drop us a line in IRC. We'll be doing more promoting tomorrow to try and
      get the hashrate to a high enough level to payout at least once a day.

- title: First DDOS, we must be doing something right
  date: 3/13/2014
  body: |
      At approx 10:06 am GMT our servers were hit with a ~1gbps DDOS. This was enough to cause Digital Ocean to null route our IP.
      We immediately began moving our server to OVH, who is well
      known for their excellent DDOS prevention. During the move we experienced ~2.5 hours of downtime while we rebuilt the server, including copying the 
      doge blockchain and our database. No shares were lost. We recommend everyone sets a backup pool if you don't
      have one already. No need for you guys to lose hashes. One plus side is that
      we moved to a waay beefier server, far more than we are using, so enjoy the snappy web performance :D
- title: Windows release for PPAgent!
  date: 3/12/2014
  body: |
      We just pushed up a windows binary for PPAgent, get it
      <a href="https://github.com/icook/ppagent/releases">here</a>. We also have improved web stats with more information
      as requested by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/latusthegoat">/u/latusthegoat</a>(thanks!), including things
      like WUE, accepted/rejected shares, fan speed, clocks speeds and HW errors.
- title: Bug squashing the new release
  date: 3/11/2014
  body: |
      The following bugs have been fixed since the release:
      <ul>
        <li>Details view for workers would show not found if your worker didn't have a name</li>
        <li>Multiple worker displays were not being converted from the hour display to day display correctly, causing workers accepted shares to look disproportionate.</li>
        <li>Graphs would sometimes show a minute when there was no data for it yet, causing a dip at the end of the graph to 0</li>
      </ul>
- title: New graphs w/ worker stats. Track your actual gpu temps and hashrate!
  date: 3/9/2014
  body: |
      We've been working hard and have lots of updates going out today we think you'll like.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Upgraded graphs</b> The new graphs are much better on mobile, have a nicer look and feel,
        and have multiple viewable timeframes.</li>
        <li><b>Also we've built out worker stats</b>
          which automatically feed into your graphs so its easy to see your hashrate across workers or drill down
          by worker and see whats going on. To show workers just change the username you are connected with,
          there is no need to 'register' a worker, use any name you want
          <pre>Username: [YourDogeAddress].[WorkerName]</pre>
        </li>
        <li><b>Track actual hashrate + gpu temps</b> we've built a script (<a
        href="http://www.github.com/icook/ppagent">ppagent</a>) you can download and install (linux
          only for now) that automatically uploads stats from your rig(s) to our pool. This allows us to
          send the hashrate reported by cgminer to our pool server and show you other things like gpu temps,
          OC, etc, through a web interface.
          </li>
        <li><b>Contact us</b> We've added an IRC channel, a subreddit, and linked some other contact methods.
          One of us is nearly always in IRC, so feel free to drop in.</li>
        <li><b>Coming soon</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Accepted/Rejected stats coming on a per worker basis</li>
          <li>Overall pool efficiency stats.</li>
          <li>We'll be adding graphs of cgminer stats generated by ppagent,
            probably temperature and hashrate first.</li>
          <li>A bit further off we see ppagent being able to allow you to remotely control your rig through the website,
            and email/text/reboot when certain events occur. The overall goal is to be able to easily control your
            rig(s) from a mobile device.
          </li>
      </ul>
- title: New guides section and other minor tweaks
  date: 3/4/2014
  body: |
      Today we've added a guides section that includes a howto on building a
      cheap rig chassis, as well as several external resources that we've found
      helpful while setting up our rigs.<br>In addition, we've also added an
      estimated daily payout to your user stats! Happy hashing.
- title: Donate to charity easily with SimpleDoge.
  date: 3/2/2014
  body: |
      SimpleDoge now allows you to mine with an aliased username to donate your
      earnings directly to charity! For more information, see our <a
      href="/charity">charity</a> page. A few stats bugs have also been patched
      with this update.
- title: Big stats upgrade and improved monitoring!
  date: 2/25/2014
  body: |
      After running for a few days the pool server is doing well with no major
      hiccups, and should be ready for more hashing power! Stats have been
      upgraded significantly to show you upcoming blocks, past payouts,
      estimated future payouts and more.
- title: Just launched!
  date: 2/23/2014
  body: |
    Simple Doge is now live! We've built an entire mining server from scratch,
    check it out on <a href="http://github.com/icook/powerpool/">github</a>.
    Please feel free to throw some hashing power our way, but its still pretty
    green so make sure to have a backup pool.
