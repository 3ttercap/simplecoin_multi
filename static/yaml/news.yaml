      After running for a few days the pool server is doing well with no major
      hiccups, and should be ready for more hashing power! Stats have been
      upgraded significantly to show you upcoming blocks, past payouts,
      estimated future payouts and more.
      <b>Be aware that some stats may still be somewhat off while we work out the kinks. Thanks for your patience.</b>

    Simple Doge is now live! We've built an entire mining server from scratch,
    check it out on <a href="http://github.com/icook/powerpool/">github</a>.
    Please feel free to throw some hashing power our way, but its still pretty
    green so make sure to have a backup pool.
