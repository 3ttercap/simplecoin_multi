SimpleCoin Multi
================

A multipool version of simplecoin.

Semi-Functional at the moment!
-----------------------------

**This project (currently) requires a few closed source projects. Automatic
exchanging is not currently possible without those components, but you can
end-to-end if you manually exchange the funds. Be prepared to dig into the code
a bit, as a lot of this is pretty green and poorly documented**

**If you're trying to get the front end working you'll need to chop the 'autoex'
dependency in a few places**

**To get payouts going you'll probably want to look at http://github.com/simplecrypto/simplecoin_rpc_client**
