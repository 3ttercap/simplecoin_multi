SimpleCoin Multi
================

A multipool version of simplecoin.

Semi-Functional at the moment!
-----------------------------

**This project (currently) requires a few closed source projects. Much of the
autoexchanging and payout code is completely missing. If you're just
trying to get the front end working you can probably accomplish that with just
chopping AutoEx in a few places, but actually running payouts isn't setup.**
