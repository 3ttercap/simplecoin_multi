SimpleCoin Multi
================

A multipool version of simplecoin.

Semi-Functional at the moment!
-----------------------------

**This project is quite green, and does not include some of the code required
to perform automatic exchanging. End-to-end functionality is possible if you
manually exchange the funds (or write your own code). Be prepared to dig into
the code a bit, as a lot of this is pretty green and often poorly documented**

**To get payouts going you'll probably want to look at http://github.com/simplecrypto/simplecoin_rpc_client**
